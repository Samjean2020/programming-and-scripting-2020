                                                Instructions on how to run the files
                                                
Python 3x programming language codes are used for the writing of the above weekly tasks. Visual Studio Code (VSC), Cmder, IPython, IPython log file, Notepad++ are text-editors used for this puropse. The programs can be run under the command line of VSC terminal, Cmder, IPython…and cloned to this repository (programming-and-scripting-2020) via the following URL address: https://github.com/Samjean2020/programming-and-scripting-2020.git. Relevant git commands, namely: git init, git clone, git add  . , git commit –m (“comments”) and git push or git pull must be used to have files added in this repository. I added files using upload files option available at GitHub.

                    Weekly task 1: running a small program, hello.py and goodbye.py

A single-line code in python is enough to provide specific instructions to be executed on a machine with an Operating System (OS): MS-DOS, UNIX OS, and LINUX OS. The call of the print() function, displays the output of the string-type of data: Hello, World for the file hello.py and Goodbye, World regarding the file goodbye.py
